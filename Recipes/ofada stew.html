    <h1>Ofada Stew Recipe</h1>
    <img src="ofada.jpg" alt="ofada stew">
    <p>This ofada stew/ofada sauce recipe features a stew that originates from the Western part of Nigeria and is commonly eaten with a locally grown rice called ofada rice. The story of Ofada rice and stew is one that somewhat inspires me. It is actually
        a culinary example of a grass to grace/ cinderella story; one that is similar to the story of many local and indigenous Nigerian foods, traditions and even languages</p>
    <p>I love how ofada stew has since evolved to becoming a cherished dish in Nigeria, so before I talk about how to make ofada stew, I’d love to share how this native delicacy evolved from being the overlooked native food to being the choice of even the
        most elite Nigerian celebrations.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>7 large bell peppers</li>
        <li>3 scotch bonnet peppers</li>
