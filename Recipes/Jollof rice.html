    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Jollof rice is a popular food in nigeria and a lot of other african countries. It is made from rice.</p>
    <p>It is usually served with various condiments from plantain to moimoi etc</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped (about 5 ounces each)</li>
        <li>½ medium Scotch bonnet pepper (or use a habanero pepper), stem removed</li>
        <li> ½ medium onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li> 3 small red bell peppers, roughly chopped (about 5 ounces each)</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons hot ground chile pepper, such as African dried chile or cayenne</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus 1 heaping teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li> 2 bay leaves</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups medium-grain rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper and onions; purée. Pour out half the purée into a bowl; set aside. Add the bell peppers to the purée remaining in the blender and pulse until smooth. Add to the mixture that was set aside and
            stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add blended vegetables along with the salt, curry powder, ground chile pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, ginger and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice until well mixed, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Cover pot and let cook until rice is al dente, about 45 minutes. Check after 30 minutes; if rice is sauce-logged, remove the lid to cook off the excess sauce. If rice seems dry, stir in 1 to 2 cups water. Allow the rice at the bottom of the pot
            to char a bit to infuse it with a smoky flavor.</li>
    </ol>
